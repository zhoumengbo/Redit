<h1>AspectJ 1.9.4</h1>
<p>The full list of resolved issues in 1.9.4 is available 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&f0=OP&f1=OP&f3=CP&f4=CP&j1=OR&list_id=16866879&product=AspectJ&query_format=advanced&target_milestone=1.9.4">here</a></h2>.</p>

<p>AspectJ 1.9.4 has a couple of important fixes in it:
<ul>
<li>Due to the new maven build process being used to build release artifacts
for the first time, there were errors in the aspectjweaver jar that affected
the ability to use it on the command line as an agent,
this is now fixed.
<li>A number of users were noticing a ClassCastException problem, which I believe was due to trying to
run AspectJ on one level of the JDK whilst targeting another. This can happen quite easily in eclipse
if running your Eclipse on Java 8 but developing projects targeting Java 11.
The class cast is because Java8 couldn't understand
the packaging of system classes post Java9 and so couldn't find java.lang.Object. This has now all been
tidied up and should work much better. More details in <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=546807">546807</a>,
thanks to Denys Khanzhyiev for some tips on getting to the right solution.
</ul>


<p>Available: 1.9.4 available 10-May-2019</p>
